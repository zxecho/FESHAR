# FESHAR: FEderated learning System for Home Assistant Robot

This is a federated learning lib for home assistant robots. Thanks to [@TsingZ0](https://github.com/TsingZ0), our codes are based on his project [
PFL-Non-IID
](https://github.com/TsingZ0/PFL-Non-IID).

We are adding more robot's tasksï¼Œ including FER, GAN, light neural networks, even LLM for HRI and so on.
